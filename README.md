## Book List


* The Book class consists of the name of the book, the number of pages, the name of the author, and the date of publication.

* Create 10 objects from the Book class and store them in an ArrayList structure. Using the stream structure and lambda expressions, write it to create a new Map<String, String> with the name of the author opposite the book name.



* Make the enhancement that filters the books with more than 100 pages from this 10-element Book list and returns them as a new list. (You can use Stream and Lambda expressions.)
